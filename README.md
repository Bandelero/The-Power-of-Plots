# Overview

The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens on Mice. My task was to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

# My Analysis

My first step was merging two CSV files to combine the "Study_Results.csv" and "Mouse_metadata.csv" into one dataframe. This is where I removed duplicates. Next, I generated a Summary Statistics table, a Bar and Pie Chart, found Quartiles, Outliers and generated Boxplots, created line and scatter plots, and lastly, did a linear regression on the mouse data. 

# Conclusion

These tasks exposed me to modules that I had not used before such as matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn and scipy.stats. Most importantly, I learned how to create a visualization comparing either Tumor Volume to weight and the change in Tumor volume over a given amount of time for each of the specific drug regimens in the study.
